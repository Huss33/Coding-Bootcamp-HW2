        <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                I have an extensive background in the service industry and most of that experience was gained in a managerial role. I have several years of working in retail where I worked my way up the totem pole. 
                Before I left retail, I had taken a department manager position. From there I made the transition to Casino Gaming industry. I quickly worked my way up the ranks and became a Floor Supervisor within a year.
                There was little turnover at the Casino I worked at so I transferred to another casino. Starting over, I again worked my way into a manager position. I gained a wealth of experience working in the casino
                industry. (insert knowledge gained). After my stint in the casino, I was hired and trained by a very promanent car dealership were I had to learn a whole new industry. My soft skills translated nicely but 
                I had to learn the car business side, which was new to me. This was a great experience, and I am gratefull for the oppourtunity that I had there at the dealership.
                <br><br>
                I recently just started taking a coding bootcamp through the University of Minnesota. I am off on another adventure to see where it will take me and just how far I can go!
